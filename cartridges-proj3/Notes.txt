 1. cartridge-returnonly            (only sets the gp and sp and returns)
 2. cartridge-base                  (good starting for any testing, calls RVCInitialize)
 3. cartridge-helloworld            (calls RVCWriteText)
 4. cartridge-controller-input      (reads controller and outputs character)
 5. cartridge-thread-switch         (creates a second thread switches to it and shoudl switch back to main)
 6. cartridge-thread-status         (same as previous but checks status/IDs)
 7. cartridge-thread-sleep          (sleeps the main thread, may be less dramatic in debug mode)
 8. cartridge-thread-wait           (creates multiple threads and calls wait)
 9. cartridge-controller-input2     (reads controller and outputs character using VT100)
10. cartridge-preempt               (creates threads that are at the same priority and are preempted)
11. cartridge-mutex                 (creates multiple threads and mutexes)
12. cartridge-memory                (tests memory pools)
13. cartridge-error-test            (tests most error codes for the system calls)
